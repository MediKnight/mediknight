## How to make a [clean] pull request
We follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow. 


Fork the repo on GitHub
Clone the project to your own machine
Commit changes to your own branch
Push your work back up to your fork
Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes
NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

- [Pull Request from a forked repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

	-	Fork the repository by clicking on the *Fork* button on the top right.
	-	Clone the repository on your local machine.
    -	Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `development` branch.
    -	Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
    -	Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
    -	Write or adapt tests as needed. There are not many so you could write.
    -	Add or change the documentation as needed.
    -	Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive `rebase`. Create a new branch if necessary.
    -	(In case of )Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
    -	From your fork open a pull request in the project's `development` branch!

  Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
And last but not least: [Commits need to be in this format](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
